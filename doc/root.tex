\label{sec:root}

The function $1/\sqrt{s}$ in the interval $[\epsilon,1]$ can be
approximated using polynomials or rational functions of different
sorts. In the tmLQCD package we use Chebysheff polynomials, which
are easy to construct. They can be constructed as to provide a desired
overall precision in the interval $[\epsilon,1]$. 

The roots of the
polynomial $P_{n,\epsilon}$ are needed for the evaluation of the
force. Even though the roots come in complex conjugate pairs, for our
case the roots cannot be computed analytically, hence we need to
determine them numerically. Such an evaluation requires usually
high precision. This is why these roots need to be determined
\emph{before} a PHMC run using an external program, i.e. they cannot
be computed at the beginning of a run in the {\ttfamily hmc\_tm}
program. 

Such an external program ships with the tmLQCD code, which is located in the
{\ttfamily util/laguere} directory\footnote{We thank Istvan Montvay
  for providing us with his code.}. It is based on Laguerre's
method and uses the Class Library for Numbers
(CLN)~\cite{cln:web}, which provides arbitrary precision data
types. In order to compute roots the CLN library must be available,
which is free software.

Taking for granted that the CLN library is available,
the procedure for computing the roots is as follows: assuming the
non-degenerate Dirac operator has eigenvalues in the interval $[\tilde
s_\mathrm{min},\tilde s_\mathrm{max}]$, i.e. $\epsilon = \tilde
s_\mathrm{min}/\tilde s_\mathrm{max}$, and the polynomial degree is
$n$. Edit the file {\ttfamily chebyRoot.H} and set the
variable {\ttfamily EPSILON} to the value of $\epsilon$. Moreover,
set the variable {\ttfamily MAXPOW} to the degree $n$. Adapt the
{\ttfamily Makefile} to your local installation and compile the code
by typing {\ttfamily make}. After running the {\ttfamily ChebyRoot}
program successfully, you should find two files in the directory
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\ttfamily Square\_root\_BR\_roots.dat}:\\
  which contains the roots of the polynomial in bit-reverse
  order~\cite{Frezzotti:1997ym}.
\item {\ttfamily normierungLocal.dat}:\\
  which contains a normalisation constant. 
\end{enumerate}
Copy these two files into the directory where you run the code and
adjust the input parameters to match \emph{exactly} the values used
for the root computation. I.e. the input parameters {\ttfamily
  StildeMin}, {\ttfamily StildeMax} and {\ttfamily
  DegreeOfMDPolynomial} must be set appropriately in the {\ttfamily
  NDPOLY} monomial. The maximal degree $\tilde n_\mathrm{max}$ for
$\tilde P$ can be influenced using {\ttfamily MaxPtildeDegree}.

The minimal and maximal eigenvalue of the non-degenerate flavour
doublet can be computed as an online measurement. The frequency can be
specified in the {\ttfamily NDPOLY} monomial with the input parameter
{\ttfamily ComputeEVFreq} and they are written to the file called
{\ttfamily phmc.data}. Note that this is not a cheap operation in
terms of computer time. However, if the approximation interval of the
polynomial is chosen wrongly the algorithm performance might
deteriorate drastically, in particular if the upper bound is set
wrongly. It is therefore advisable to introduce some security measure
in particular in the value of $\tilde s_\mathrm{max}$. 

While the degree of the MD polynomial can be adjusted in the input
file, the degree of $\tilde P$ used in the heatbath and acceptance
steps is computed at the beginning of the run depending on the
precision specified in the input file. The procedure is as
follows: Compute the first $\tilde n_\mathrm{max}$
coefficients $d_i$ of the polynomial. Then determine the degree
$\tilde n$ of $\tilde P$ such that 
\[
\sum_{i=n}^{n_\mathrm{max}} d_i < \epsilon
\]
where $\epsilon$ is set using the input parameter {\ttfamily
  PrecisionPtilde}.
