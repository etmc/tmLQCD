\subsection{Input parameter for main program}

The main programs are called {\ttfamily hmc\_tm} for the HMC algorithm
and {\ttfamily invert} for even odd preconditioned inversion. They can
be called with
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily -f filename}:\\
  where {\ttfamily filename} is the name of the input file to be
  used. The default name is {\ttfamily hmc.input} for
  {\ttfamily hmc\_tm} and {\ttfamily invert.input} for 
  {\ttfamily invert}.

\item {\ttfamily -o name}:\\
  {\ttfamily name} will be used as name for several output files. This
  files differ by their suffix. Default for {\ttfamily name} is
  {\ttfamily output}.

\item {\ttfamily -v  }:\\
  makes the code a bit more verbose. Unrelated to input parameter
  {\ttfamily DebugLevel}.

\item {\ttfamily -?|-h}:\\
  This will produce help output and exit then.

\end{itemize}

There are several input parameters read from an input file. The parser
is contained in the file {\ttfamily gwc/src/bin/read\_input.l}. The
file {\ttfamily read\_input.l} is converted to {\ttfamily
  read\_input.c} using {\ttfamily flex} and defines the following
function: 

Definition:\\
\begin{ttfamily}
  int read\_input(char * conf\_file)
\end{ttfamily}\\

\begin{tabular}[h]{l l l}
{\ttfamily conf\_file} & in & string with input file name\\ 
\end{tabular}

The functions returns $0$, if no error occurs, $2$, if the input file
could not be opened. If no input file could be opened or if there is
no value given in the input file for a paramter, default values are
used. All default values can be found in the file {\ttfamily
  gwc/src/bin/default\_input\_values.h}. The syntax is mostly
{\ttfamily keyword = value} and {\ttfamily keyword} must be at the
beginning of the line. Comments starting with {\ttfamily \#} and empty
lines are allowed. The order of the lines is not importand as long as
every keyword appears only once.  If it appears more than once, the
last appearance becomes valid. The parser is case-insensitive.

In the following a list of the currently
supported general input paramters: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\ttfamily T}:\\
  The global time extension of the lattice. Default is $4$.

\item {\ttfamily L}:\\
  The global spatial extension of the lattice. Default is $4$.

\item {\ttfamily LX}:\\
  The global spatial x-extension of the lattice. Default is $4$.

\item {\ttfamily LY}:\\
  The global spatial y-extension of the lattice. Default is $4$.

\item {\ttfamily LZ}:\\
  The global spatial z-extension of the lattice. Default is $4$.

\item {\ttfamily NrXProcs}:\\
  The number of processors in x-direction in case of two dimensional
  parallelisation. This has no effect in case of one dimensional
  parallelisation. In case of two dimensional parallelisation it must
  be properly set. The number of processors in time direction is
  automatically computed.

\item {\ttfamily NrYProcs, NrZProcs}:\\
  See {\ttfamily NrXProcs}.

\item {\ttfamily seed}:\\
  The seed for the random number generator. Default value is $123456$.

\item {\ttfamily kappa}:\\
  The $\kappa$ value. Default is $0.12$.

\item {\ttfamily 2KappaMu}:\\
  Twisted mass parameter (the physical one) for twisted mass
  action. This is for internal reasons $2\kappa\mu$.

\item {\ttfamily 2KappaMuBar}:\\
  The average mass of the heavy doublet multiplied with $2\kappa$

\item {\ttfamily 2KappaEpsBar}:\\
  The splitting mass multiplied with $2\kappa$

\item {\ttfamily Measurements}:\\
  Number of measurements in units of trajectories to be done. Default
  value is $3$. For the {\ttfamily invert} programme this counts the
  number of gauge configurations to invert on. (See {\ttfamily Nsave}
  for the increment in the gauge index!)

\item {\ttfamily Nsave}:\\
  For {\ttfamily hmc\_tm}: save every n-th trajectory the
  configuration to disk. 
  For the {\ttfamily invert} programme it means that every n-th
  configuration is measured. This was formerly called {\ttfamily
    Nskip}.
  
  For {\ttfamily invert}: if more than one measurement is performed
  (see {\ttfamily Measurements} parameter),
  the gauge index is incremented by {\ttfamily Nsave} for each new
  measurement. 

\item {\ttfamily InitialStoreCounter}:\\
  Start with value to label measurements. Default is $0$. Can be also
  set to {\ttfamily readin} which causes to let the code check for a
  file {\ttfamily .nstore\_counter} and reads the initial value from
  this file. If it is not existing, the counter will be set to $0$.

\item {\ttfamily GaugeConfigInputFile}:\\
  Name of input file for the gauge field. Default is {\ttfamily conf}

\item {\ttfamily ThetaT|X|Y|Z=x}:\\
  This sets the boundary condition angle for the fermion fields in
  $t$, $x$, $y$ or $z$ direction to $\theta_t = \pi x$. Default value is
  zero. A value of $1$ would mean antiperiodic boundary conditions
  for the fermion fields.

\item {\ttfamily DebugLevel}:\\
  If set to a value larger than $0$ this causes verbose output:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily DebugLevel = 1}: forces, iteration counts and flops are printed out.
  \item {\ttfamily DebugLevel = 2}: every iteration step is
    printed. Chronological Solver gives details about which routines
    are called, the same for the monomials. polynomial gets more verbose.
  \item {\ttfamily DebugLevel > 2}: all available normal output.
  \item {\ttfamily DebugLevel > 3}: all debug output. Involves extra
    computations, so the code will be (significantly) slower
  \end{itemize}

\item {\ttfamily UseSloppyPrecision}:\\
  Use a reduced precision Dirac operator in the MC part of the
  HMC. Possible values are yes and no, the latter being the
  default. This could be possibly used in the invert code along the 
  lines of {\ttfamily hep-lat/0609023} in the future.

\item {\ttfamily DisableIOChecks}:\\
  Defaults to no, if set to yes, this will disable several checks
  performed on gauge configuration input files, such size verification or
  SciDAC checksum matching. It will also disable the readback performed with
  Lemon IO.

\item {\ttfamily GaugeConfigRead|WritePrecision}:\\
  Read/Write gauge configurations in single (32) or double (64)
  precision. Default is 64.

\item {\ttfamily UseEvenOdd}:\\
  Whether or not to use even/odd preconditioning in the invert
  executable.

\end{enumerate}

The following input parameters are {\ttfamily invert} specific:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\ttfamily Indices=n-m}:\\
  Compute only components $n$ to $m$ of the quark propagator. $n,m$ must
  be in $[0,99]$. If the start index is not zero the data will be
  appended to the propagator file, unless {\ttfamily
    SplittedPropagator} is chosen. The program does not take care of the
  order, the data is just appended!

\item {\ttfamily UseRelativePrecision}:\\
  Possible values {\ttfamily yes, no}. Indicates whether relative
  precision is used in the inversions for the force and the acceptance
  computation. Default is no.
  
\item {\ttfamily GMRESMParameter}:\\
  Krylov subspace size $m$ in GMRES($m$) and such like iterative
  solvers. Not yet working!

\item {\ttfamily GMRESDRNrEv}:\\
  Number of eigenvalues to be deflated in GMRES-DR iterative
  solver. Not yet working!

\item {\ttfamily ReadSource}:\\
  If set to yes, then the source vector is read from a file.

\item {\ttfamily SourceTimeSlice}:\\
  The time slice of the source to be read. At
  the moment used only for
  the automatic construction of filenames. The filename will then be
  constructed as {\ttfamily basefilename.nstore.ts.index}.
  {\ttfamily SourceTimeSlice} can be also set to {\ttfamily detect} in
  order to let the code determine the appropriate timeslice
  value. (this might be slow, though, but it is unavoidable if
  {\ttfamily invert} should run more than one gauge in a single run
  and the timeslice value changes on a gauge basis.)

  It has only effect, if every source is in a separate file
  (i.e. SourceInfo.splitted is set, which is the default).

\item {\ttfamily NoSamples}:\\
  in case of stochastic source the number of samples.

\item {\ttfamily SourceType}:\\
  lets you chose the source type: {\ttfamily Volume, Point, TimeSlice}
  are possible here.

\item {\ttfamily ComputeEVs}:\\
  compute eigenvalues and vectors before inversion in invert. Values
  can be no, yes and readin. In the latter case the eigenvalues and
  vectors are only read from disk, if possible. In case of yes it is
  also tried to read them from disk, but they are also recomputed, to
  a possibly higher precision.

\item {\ttfamily NoEigenvalues}:\\
  number of eigenvalues to compute.

\item {\ttfamily EigenvaluePrecision}:\\
  precision for eigenvalues.

\item {\ttfamily ComputeModeNumber}:\\
  compute the topological susceptibility using the spectral projectors
  method. Values can be yes or no.

\item {\ttfamily ComputeModeNumber}:\\
  compute the average number of eigenmodes of the massive hermitian
  operator $D_{tm}^{\dagger}D_{tm}+m^2$ with eigenvalues
  $\alpha\leq M^2$. The value can be
  yes and no.

\item {\ttfamily MStarSq}:\\
  value of the parameter $M_*^2$ necessary in order to compute the
  mode number or the topological susceptibility using the method of
  the spectral projectors.

\item {\ttfamily NoSourcesZ2}:\\
  number of Z2 stochastic sources for the spectral projectors method.

\item {\ttfamily SourceLocation}:\\
  integer indicating the location of the source. The location is computed as
  {\ttfamily SourceLocation = z+L*y+L*L*x+L*L*L*t}.

\item {\ttfamily UseStoutSmearing}:\\
  Whether or not to stout smear the configuration before inversion.

\item {\ttfamily StoutRho} and {\ttfamily StoutNoIterations}:\\
  Stout smearing parameter.

\item {\ttfamily WritePropagatorFormat} or {\ttfamily PropagatorType}:\\
  The type in which to store the propagator. There are 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily DiracFermion\_Sink}
  \item {\ttfamily DiracFermion\_Source\_Sink\_Pairs}
  \item {\ttfamily DiracFermion\_ScalarSource\_TwelveSink}
  \item {\ttfamily DiracFermion\_ScalarSource\_FourSink}
  \end{itemize}
  available. However, only the first two are implemented so far.

\item {\ttfamily ComputeReweightingFactor}:\\
  If enabled reweighting factors will be computed corresponding to
  monomials that must be specified in the input file as well.

\item {\ttfamily NoReweightingSamples}:\\
  Number of random samples used per gauge configuration to estimate
  the reweighting factor. The default is $10$.

\end{enumerate}

%\noindent $n_f=2+1+1$ related input parameters, where the heavy part of the actions
%reads
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:haction}
%  S_{F,h} = \bar\psi_h\left[ \delta_{x,y}(1+i\gamma_5\bar\mu\tau^3 +
%    \bar\epsilon\tau^1)
%  - \kappa\sum_\mu \delta_{x,y+\mu}(1+\gamma_\mu)U_{y,\mu}\right] \psi_h
%\end{equation}

The following input parameters are {\ttfamily hmc\_tm} specific:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {ThermalisationSweeps}:\\
  As longer as the number of trajectories is smaller than this number
  the acceptance test will be discarded. This might help to faster
  equilibrate the system.

\item {\ttfamily Startcondition}:\\
  The starting condition for a run. Possible values are {\ttfamily
    hot, cold, restart, continue}. Default is {\ttfamily
    cold}. Restart uses the seed to reset the random number
  generator. In case of {\ttfamily continue} the programme uses the
  file {\ttfamily .nstore\_counter} to get the information about from
  where to read the gauge and the random number status. If this file
  does not exist (its written in the course of the HMC) then the input
  parameter described here are used instead.

\item {\ttfamily BCGstabMaxIter}:\\
  The maximal number of iterations in the BiCGstab solver.

\item {\ttfamily CGMaxIter}:\\
  The maximal number of iterations in the CG solver.

\item {\ttfamily ReversibilityCheck}:\\
  If set to {\ttfamily yes} the program will perform a check of
  reversibility violation in the integrator by integrating back in
  time. If not yet existing, the program creates a file {\ttfamily
    return\_check.data} in which it stores the reversibility violation
  as the difference in the Hamiltonian, the difference in the gauge
  fields and the relative difference in the Hamiltonian.

\item {\ttfamily ReversibilityCheckIntervall}:\\
  Here one can specify the intervall in terms of trajectories the
  program should check the reversibility violation.

\end{enumerate}
Following the CHROMA notation we call every part in the action a
monomial. A monomial is added to the action in the input file in the
following way:
\begin{verbatim}
BeginMonomial TYPE
  Option = value
EndMonomial
\end{verbatim}
{\ttfamily TYPE} can be one of the following
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily DET}: pseudo fermion representation of the (mass degenerate)\\
  \[
  \det(Q^2(\kappa) + \mu^2)
  \]
\item {\ttfamily DETRATIO}: pseudo fermion representation of\\
  \[
  \det(Q^2(\kappa) + \mu^2)/\det(Q^2(\kappa_2) + \mu_2^2)
  \]
\item {\ttfamily GAUGE}:\\
  \[
  \frac{\beta}{3}\sum_x\left(  c_0\sum_{\substack{
        \mu,\nu=1\\1\leq\mu<\nu}}^4\{1-\re\tr(U^{1\times1}_{x,\mu,\nu})\}\Bigr. 
    \Bigl.\ +\ 
    c_1\sum_{\substack{\mu,\nu=1\\\mu\neq\nu}}^4\{1
    -\re\tr(U^{1\times2}_{x,\mu,\nu})\}\right)\,  ,
  \]
\item {\ttfamily NDPOLY}: polynomial representation of the (possibly
  non-degenerate) doublet\\
  \[
  [\det(Q_{nd}(\bar\epsilon, \bar\mu)^2)]^{1/2}
  \]
\item {\ttfamily POLY}: polynomial approximation ($P_n(x) \approx \frac{1}{x}$) of the mass degenerate determinant\\
  \[
  \left[\det(P_{n}(Q^2(\kappa) + \mu^2))\right]^{-1}
  \]
\item {\ttfamily POLYDETRATIO}: pseudo fermion representation of (for PHMC + mass precondition)\\
  \[
  \left[\det(P_{n}(Q^2(\kappa) + \mu^2)) det(Q^2(\kappa_2) + \mu^2_2)\right]^{-1}
  \]
\end{itemize}
Each of them has different options:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily DET}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily 2KappaMu}
  \item {\ttfamily Kappa}
  \item {\ttfamily Timescale}: the timescale on which to integrate
    this monomial. Counting starts from zero up to the total number of
    timescales minus 1.
  \item {\ttfamily CSGHistory}: the maximal number of vectors to store
    for the chronolical predictor (for CG and BiCGstab), default $0$.
  \item {\ttfamily CSGHistory2}: the maximal number of vectors to store
    for the second chronolical predictor (for BiCGstab only), default
    $0$.
  \item {\ttfamily ForcePrecision}: the solver precision used in the
    force computation
  \item {\ttfamily AcceptancePrecision}: the solver precision used in the
    acceptance and heatbath
  \item {\ttfamily MaxSolverIterations}: default is $5000$
  \item {\ttfamily Solver}: the solver to be used, either CG or
    BiCGstab. Default is CG.
  \item {\ttfamily Name}: a name to be assigned to the monomial. The
    default is {\ttfamily DET}
  \end{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily DETRATIO}: the same as for {\ttfamily DET}, but in
  addition:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily 2KappaMu2}
  \item {\ttfamily Kappa2}
  \item {\ttfamily Name}: a name to be assigned to the monomial. The
    default is {\ttfamily DETRATIO}
  \end{itemize}


\item {\ttfamily GAUGE}:

    this monomial. Counting starts from zero up to the total number of
    timescales minus 1.
  \item {\ttfamily Name}: a name to be assigned to the monomial. The
    default is {\ttfamily GAUGE}.

  \item {\ttfamily beta}:\\
    The invers coupling $\beta$. Default value is $5.2$.
    
  \item {\ttfamily Type}: can be one of\ {\ttfamily Wilson, tlsym,
      Iwasaki, DBW2, user}. For type user you can specify also the two
    following options. Default is {\ttfamily user} here.
  \item {\ttfamily UseRectangleStaples}: can be yes or no, indicating
    whether to use also the rectangle staples. No corresponds to pure
    Wilson plaquette. Default is no. Is effective only for {\ttfamily
      type = user}.
  \item {\ttfamily RectangleCoefficient}: the value of the parameter
    $c_1$. The coefficient $c_0$ is computed from $c_0 = 1-8c_1$. Is
    effective only for {\ttfamily type = user}.
  \end{itemize}
  There is maximally one instance allowed of this type.


\item {\ttfamily NDPOLY}: more a dummy monomial so far, but switches
  on the PHMC part for the non-degenerate heavy doublet and lets you
  specify the timescale on which to integrate this and the parameters.
  \begin{itemize}

  \item {\ttfamily Timescale}: the timescale on which to integrate
    this monomial. Counting starts from zero up to the total number of
    timescales minus 1.

  \item {\ttfamily Name}: a name to be assigned to the monomial. The
    default is {\ttfamily NDPOLY}

  \item {\ttfamily ComputeEVFreq}:
    If you want to calculate the eigenvalues every n'th trajectory
    then set this parameter to n if you want no eigenvalues set this to 0
    during thermalization you should set this to 1 or 2 to follow the evolution
    of smallest and largest eigenvalue to adjust the approximation interval
    of the polynomial

  \item {\ttfamily ComputeOnlyEVs}: Computes only once at the very
    beginning of the run the eigenvalues of the heavy split operator
    and exits.

  \item {\ttfamily StildeMin}: lower bound for the approximation interval of the polynomial

  \item {\ttfamily StildeMax}:
    upper bound for the approximation interval of the polynomial

  \item {\ttfamily DegreeOfMDPolynomial}:
    degree of the less precise polynomial $P$. Must be identical to the
    degree used to compute the roots.

  \item {\ttfamily LocNormConst}:
    Constant (local normalisation constant) which is multiplied to each monomial (of the polynomial $P_n$).
  \item {\ttfamily RootsFile}:
    File name specifying a file containing the $n=$ {\ttfamily Degree} roots of the Polynomial

  \item {\ttfamily PrecisionPtilde}:
    Precision of the more precise polynomial $\tilde P$ used in the
    heat-bath and the acceptance step of the PHMC.

  \item {\ttfamily PrecisionHfinal}:
  \end{itemize}
  So far, there is maximally one instance allowed for this type. This
  might change in the future.
\item {\ttfamily POLY, POLYDETRATIO}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily Degree}:
    Degree of the Polynomial.
  \item {\ttfamily Lmin}:
    Lower bound of approximation interval.
  \item {\ttfamily Lmax}:
    Upper bound of approximation interval.
  \item {\ttfamily LocNormConst}:
    Constant (local normalisation constant) which is multiplied to each monomial (of the polynomial $P_n$).
  \item {\ttfamily RootsFile}:
    File name specifying a file containing the $n=$ {\ttfamily Degree} roots of the Polynomial
  \item {\ttfamily + Parameters from DET \& DETRATIO monomial}
  \end{itemize}
There can be arbitrary many POLY monomials. But take into account that there will be allocated $n/2$ number of spinor fields for EACH poly monomial. (Maybe in the future we should think about to share these fields with all POLY/NDPOLY monomials as there are used only for the computation of the force and have to be updated before each successive calculation of the force.)\\
This monomial needs a valid {\ttfamily RootsFile} and {\ttfamily LocNormConst} parameter. Both can be obtained from the {\ttfamily oox} program in the {\ttfamily util/oox} subdirectory of the hmc code. It can be invoked by the command:\\
{\ttfamily \$ oox -d <degree> -e <epsilon>}\\
{\ttfamily <epsilon>} is to be replaced by the ratio  {\ttfamily Lmin/Lmax}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Integrator}

The Integrator can be specified similar to the monomials:
\begin{verbatim}
BeginIntegrator
  Option = value
EndIntegrator
\end{verbatim}
with the following options available:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily Tau}: total trajectory length.
\item {\ttfamily NumberOfTimescales}: total number of timescales.
\item {\ttfamily IntegrationStepsN = M} where {\ttfamily N} is the
  timescale (as integer value, counting starts from zero and goes up
  to the number of timescales minus 1) and {\ttfamily M} is the number
  of integration steps on that timescale. Note, that the integrators
  or defined recursively.
\item {\ttfamily LambdaN = F} where {\ttfamily N} is the
  timescale and {\ttfamily F} is a floating point number specifying
  the $\lambda$ value to be used on this timescale in case of the
  second order minimal norm integrator (2MN, 2MNPOSITION). The default
  value is $0.19$. Note, that $\lambda = 1/6$ is the Sexton-Weingarte
  scheme. 
\item {\ttfamily TypeN = TYPE}: set the type of integrator to be used
  on timescale {\ttfamily N}. The following types available:
  {\ttfamily 2MN, 2MNPOSITION, LEAPFROG}

  The position versions are not compatible with the velocity versions,
  thus they must not be used together.
\end{itemize}
A timescale must not be empty. Currently the maximal number of
timescales is $10$ and there cannot be more than $10$ monomials per
timescale. But there can be more than one monomial per timescale.

\subsubsection{Chosing the Operator for Inversions}

\begin{verbatim}
BeginOperator TYPE
  Option = value
EndOperator
\end{verbatim}
{\ttfamily TYPE} can be one of the following

  \item {\ttfamily UseEvenOdd}
  \end{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily TMWILSON}: Wilson Twisted Mass Dirac operator, with
  options:

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
All of them provide the following options available:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily kappa}:
\item {\ttfamily Solver}:\\
  Sets the solver to be used. Possible values are among others
  {\ttfamily CG, BiCGstab, CGS, GMRES, PCG}.
\item {\ttfamily MaxSolverIterations}:
\item {\ttfamily PropagatorPrecision}:
\item {\ttfamily SolverPrecision}:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Online Measurements}

A number of measurements can be performed online while the hmc is
running. 
\begin{verbatim}
BeginMeasurement TYPE
  Option = value
EndMeasurement
\end{verbatim}
where {\ttfamily TYPE} can be currently one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\ttfamily CORRELATORS}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily MaxSolverIterations}
  \end{itemize}
  this is for zero temperature, so the stochastic source is at fixed $t$.
\item {\ttfamily PIONNORM}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily MaxSolverIterations}
  \end{itemize}
  this is for finite temperature, the stochastic source is at fixed $z$.

\item {\ttfamily POLYAKOVLOOP}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily Directions} can be either $0$ for time- or $3$ for z-direction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The frequency of measuring all of these can be adjusted with the
Option {\ttfamily Frequency}.

\subsubsection{Reread functionality}

If you store a file with name {\ttfamily hmc.reread} in the working
directory of a running HMC, the program will read in this file after
the next finished trajectory. Then it will change the parameters
accordingly without the need of restarting the program. 

One cannot change from gauge action without rectangle part to gauge
action with rectangle part. If one wants to change $\mu$-,
$\epsilon^2$- or $N_i$-parameter one has to give allways all of
them. Otherwise the internal matching does not work and the program
will do nonsense.

The file will be deleted automatically, if it was used. A message will
be posted to standard output and to the file {\ttfamily
  history\_hmc\_tm} to let you identify the exact point where the
parameters changed.
