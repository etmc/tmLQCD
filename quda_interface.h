*
* Integration of the QUDA inverter for multi-GPU usage
*
* The externally accessible functions are
*
*   void _initQuda( int verbose )  
*     Initializes the QUDA library. Carries over the lattice size and the 
*     MPI process grid and thus must be called after initializing MPI (and 
*     after 'read_infile(argc,argv)').
*     Memory for the QUDA gaugefield on the host is allocated but not filled 
*     yet (the latter is done in _loadGaugeQuda(), see below). 
*     Performance critical settings are done here and can be changed.
*     Input parameter: verbose (0=SILENT, 1=SUMMARIZE, 2=VERBOSE).
*
*   void _endQuda()
*     Finalizes the QUDA library. Call before MPI_Finalize().
*
*   void _loadGaugeQuda()
*     Copies and reorders the gaugefield on the host and copies it to the GPU.
*     Must be called between last changes on the gaugefield (smearing, flip 
*     boundary conditions, etc.) and first call of the inverter.
*
*   double tmcgne_quda(int nmx,double res,int k,int l,int *status,int *ifail)
*     The same functionality as 'tmcgne' (see tmcg.c) but inversion is performed on 
*     the GPU using QUDA. Final residuum check is performed on the host (CPU)
*     with the function 'void tmQnohat_dble(int k,int l)' (see tmdirac.c).
*
*   void tmQnohat_quda(int k, int l)
*     The implementation of the QUDA equivalent of 'tmQnohat_dble'. 
*
*
* Notes:
*
* Minimum QUDA version is 0.7.0 (see https://github.com/lattice/quda/issues/151 
* and https://github.com/lattice/quda/issues/157).
*
* To enable compilation of the same code for QUDA usage and standard non-QUDA usage, 
* all calls of these functions should be wrapped in precompiler switches of the form
*
*   #ifdef QUDA
*     ...
*   #endif  
*
