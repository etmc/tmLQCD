*
* Interface to QUDA for multi-GPU inverters
*
* The externally accessible functions are
*
*   void _initQuda()
*     Initializes the QUDA library. Carries over the lattice size and the
*     MPI process grid and thus must be called after initializing MPI.
*     Currently it is called in init_operators() if optr->use_qudainverter
*     flag is set.
*     Memory for the QUDA gaugefield on the host is allocated but not filled
*     yet (the latter is done in _loadGaugeQuda(), see below).
*     Performance critical settings are done here and can be changed.
*
*   void _endQuda()
*     Finalizes the QUDA library. Call before MPI_Finalize().
*
*   void _loadGaugeQuda()
*     Copies and reorders the gaugefield on the host and copies it to the GPU.
*     Must be called between last changes on the gaugefield (smearing etc.)
*     and first call of the inverter. In particular, 'boundary(const double kappa)'
*     must be called before if nontrivial boundary conditions are to be used since
*     those will be applied directly to the gaugefield. Currently it is called just
*     before the inversion is done (might result in wasted loads...).
*
*   The functions
*
*     int invert_eo_quda(...);
*     int invert_doublet_eo_quda(...);
*     void M_full_quda(...);
*     void D_psi_quda(...);
*
*   mimic their tmLQCD counterparts in functionality as well as input and
*   output parameters. The invert functions will check the parameters
*   g_mu, g_c_sw do decide which QUDA operator to create.
*
*   To activate those, set "UseQudaInverter = yes" in the operator
*   declaration of the input file. For details see the documentation.
*
*   The function
*
*     int invert_quda_direct(...);
*
*   provides a direct interface to the QUDA solver and is not accessible through
*   the input file.
*
* Notes:
*
* Minimum QUDA version is 0.7.0 (see https://github.com/lattice/quda/issues/151 
* and https://github.com/lattice/quda/issues/157).
