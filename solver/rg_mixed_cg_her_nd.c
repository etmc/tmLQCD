 **********************
 *
 * Mixed precision solver which uses true reliable updates and has a double
 * precision fail-safe mechanism. The Polak-Ribiere computation of beta is
 * implemented but currently not used because the extra scalar product is
 * more expensive than the gain from the self-stabilisation as far as has 
 * been tested.
 *
 * in:
 *   Q: source
 * input:
 *   P: result
 *
 * POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
 * There are still quite a few things that can be tried to make it better,
 * the most significant of which would be to guide the search direction
 * using the previous one upon restart. However, it seems that for the number
 * non-zero entries in the Dirac operator and usual lattice sizes, the
 * requisite projection 
 *
 *   p' = r - <r,Ap>/<p,Ap> p
 *
 * cannot be computed with sufficient precision in 64 bit arithmetic. It should
 * be noted that for L < 24 in general, this does work and produces
 * a mixed solver which converges at the same rate as a double solver, but it's
 * not generally useable... For point sources, it also works for larger lattice 
 * volumes. Might be introduced as an optional mode in the future with some
 * fail-safe mechanism which detects if the search direction begins to diverge.
